The user has reported several issues with the previously generated PyQt6 chat application and wants them fixed. Let's break down each issue and think about the solution before writing the code.

Issues to Address:

Chat Display Justification: The user wants the chat content to be left-justified. Currently, it's aligned based on sender (left for AI, right for user). We need to ensure all content within each message bubble is left-justified, while maintaining the bubble alignment (AI left, User right).

User Input Area Improvements:

Text Wrap and Max Lines: The QLineEdit is single-line. We need to replace it with QTextEdit to support multi-line input with text wrapping and a vertical scrollbar after 5 lines.

Enter Key Behavior: "Enter" should insert a newline, not send the message.

Send Button Trigger: Message submission should only happen when the "Send" button is clicked, not on "Enter".

Emoji Button Functionality: Implement an emoji picker pop-up dialog. This will involve:

Creating a new QDialog for the emoji picker.

Populating it with common emojis (perhaps in buttons or a grid layout).

Adding a "Close" button.

When an emoji is picked, it should be inserted into the QTextEdit input area.

OpenAI API Call Error (404 Not Found): The screenshot shows a "404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://api.openai.com/v1". This suggests the API URL is likely incorrect in the configuration or the default URL hardcoded in the previous code if any. We need to:

Ensure the api_configuration.yaml and the configuration dialog correctly handle and save the API URL.

Double-check the API URL used in the call_api function. It should come from the configuration.

The default API URL https://api.openai.com/v1 might be a placeholder and needs to be configured by the user to their actual API endpoint.

Plan of Action:

Code Review: Re-examine the previous code to identify the sections related to chat display, user input, emoji button, and API calls.

Chat Display Fix (Justification): Modify the CSS style in display_message function to enforce left justification within the message content div.

User Input Area Fix:

Replace QLineEdit with QTextEdit.

Configure QTextEdit for text wrapping and set a maximum height to simulate 5 lines with a scrollbar.

Disconnect the returnPressed signal from QLineEdit (if it was connected).

Connect the send_message function only to the send_button.clicked signal.

Modify send_message to get text from QTextEdit.

Emoji Button Implementation:

Create a new function show_emoji_picker() that creates and shows an emoji picker QDialog.

Populate the dialog with emoji buttons.

Each emoji button's clicked signal should be connected to a function that inserts the emoji into the QTextEdit and closes the emoji picker dialog.

Add a "Close" button to the emoji picker dialog.

API Call and 404 Error Fix:

Verify that the API URL is correctly loaded from api_configuration.yaml in the call_api function.

Ensure the API_Url field in the configuration dialog is correctly saved to api_configuration.yaml.

The default api.openai.com/v1 in the error message suggests it might be the base URL, and the specific endpoint for chat completion might be missing (e.g., /chat/completions). We need to make sure the user configures the full API endpoint if necessary, or update the code to construct the correct endpoint based on a base URL. For now, let's assume the user needs to provide the complete endpoint in the configuration.

Testing and Simulation: After implementing each fix, test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and that no regressions are introduced. Specifically test:

Chat display justification.

User input area behavior (text wrap, max lines, Enter key, Send button).

Emoji picker functionality.

API calls with valid and invalid configurations to check error handling and the 404 issue.

Let's start implementing these fixes step by step.
