The user wants to enhance the ai_chat_app-v2.py application with several improvements. I need to carefully consider each enhancement, evaluate implementation options, and then merge the best options into a new version of the code. The new code must be complete, tested, and working, without placeholders.

Here are the enhancements and my plan for each:

Use openai library for API calls:

Options:

Replace requests.post with openai.OpenAI().chat.completions.create(...).

Need to install openai library if not already present (pip install openai).

Adapt the existing API configuration to fit the openai library's requirements (e.g., base_url, api_key).

Optimal Choice: Using openai library directly is the most straightforward way to align with sample_code_openai_compatible_api.py and is generally recommended for interacting with OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Improved API Error Display:

Options:

Change background color of AI error messages in chat_browser.

Add an error icon next to error messages.

Use a different HTML style for error messages (e.g., bold, different font).

Optimal Choice: Changing the background color is simple and effective for visual distinction. I'll use a distinct color like lightcoral for API error messages. I will keep the existing display_message function and add a parameter to control styling for error messages.

Configuration Error Messages:

Options:

Use QMessageBox.warning in the save_config function to show validation errors.

Perform validation in save_config before saving and show messages for specific errors (empty API key, invalid URL, etc.).

Optimal Choice: Use QMessageBox.warning to show specific error messages within the save_config function. I'll add checks for empty API Key and basic URL validation (check if it starts with http:// or https://).

Model Selection with QComboBox:

Options:

Replace QLineEdit for Model input with QComboBox in show_config_dialog.

Pre-populate QComboBox with a list of common models.

Allow users to type in the QComboBox as well (editable combo box).

Optimal Choice: Use a QComboBox and pre-populate it with a list of common models like "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4", etc. Make it editable so users can also enter custom model names.

Temperature Slider Label:

Options:

Modify the temperature_label text to show "Temperature (0.0 - 1.0): [value]".

Optimal Choice: Simply update the temperature_label.setText in the temperature_slider.valueChanged lambda function to include the "(0.0 - 1.0)" text.

File Attachment State as Instance Variables:

Options:

Remove setProperty and property calls on self.input_box.

Add self.attached_file_content and self.attached_file_name as instance variables in AIChatApp.__init__.

Update attach_file, send_message, and related functions to use these instance variables directly.

Optimal Choice: This is a straightforward refactoring for code clarity. I will replace the property usage with instance variables.

Code Generation Plan:

Start with the original ai_chat_app-v2.py code.

Modify call_api function to use openai.OpenAI library. Install openai if needed (although I will assume it's installed and include the import).

Modify display_message to accept an is_error parameter and style error messages with a lightcoral background. Update the error handling part of call_api to use this.

Update save_config to add validation for API URL and API Key and use QMessageBox.warning for error messages.

Modify show_config_dialog to replace QLineEdit with QComboBox for model selection and pre-populate it.

Update temperature_slider.valueChanged in show_config_dialog to update temperature_label text with "(0.0 - 1.0)".

Refactor AIChatApp class to use self.attached_file_content and self.attached_file_name instance variables instead of QTextEdit properties. Update related methods.

Thoroughly test the modified code:

API calls with valid and invalid configurations.

Error message display.

Configuration dialog validation.

Model selection using dropdown and manual input.

Temperature slider label.

File attachment and message sending.

Export/Import chat history.

Ensure no regressions in other functionalities.

Output the complete, tested code.
