**📖 Lunar New Year 2025: The Snake’s Gift 🐍✨**  

In the misty mountains of *Linghua Village*, 12-year-old **Mei** discovered a wounded serpent with jade-green scales. Against her family’s warnings (“Snakes bring bad luck!”), she secretly nursed it back to health. On New Year’s Eve, the village faced disaster: the *River of Prosperity* had frozen solid, blocking trade and trapping everyone.  

That night, the serpent transformed into a **celestial spirit** — *Shenlong*, guardian of the Snake Zodiac. “Your kindness has thawed my heart,” it hissed. “Break the ice with *truth*.”  

Mei rallied the villagers: “The river froze because we’ve ignored its needs — dumping waste, overfishing!” Ashamed, they pledged to restore the river. At midnight, the ice cracked, revealing **golden koi** swimming upstream — a sign of renewed fortune.  

**🐉 The Revelation**  
Shenlong gifted Mei a scale that glowed like moonlight: “The Snake’s power lies not in venom, but in ***shedding old skins*** — adaptability and wisdom.”  

The next morning, Linghua celebrated with *dragon dances* and **sticky rice cakes shaped like coiled snakes**. Mei’s family hung a new couplet:  
*”Wisdom flows like the river; renewal springs from the heart.”*  

**🎉 Moral**: The Year of the Snake (2025) reminds us that *true transformation begins with introspection and care for the world around us*.
